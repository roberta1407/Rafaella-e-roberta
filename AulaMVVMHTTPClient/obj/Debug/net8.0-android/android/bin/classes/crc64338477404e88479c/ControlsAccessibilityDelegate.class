NOTIFY = array('USERID','NotifyFn');</font>
</pre>
<p> NOTE 2: If you want to change the EXPIREREF after the session
record has been created, you will need to modify any session variable
to force a database record update.
</p>
<h3>Neat Notification Tricks</h3>
<p><i>ExpireRef</i> normally holds the user id of the current session.
</p>
<p>1. You can then write a session monitor, scanning expireref to see
who is currently logged on.
</p>
<p>2. If you delete the sessions record for a specific user, eg.
</p>
<pre>delete from sessions where expireref = '$USER'<br></pre>
then the user is logged out. Useful for ejecting someone from a
site.
<p>3. You can scan the sessions table to ensure no user
can be logged in twice. Useful for security reasons.

<h2>Compression/Encryption Schemes</h2>
Since ADOdb 4.05, thanks to Ross Smith, multiple encryption and
compression schemes are supported. Currently, supported are:
<p>
<pre>  MD5Crypt (crypt.inc.php)<br>  MCrypt<br>  Secure (Horde's emulation of MCrypt, if MCrypt module is not available.)<br>  GZip<br>  BZip2<br></pre>
<p>These are stackable. E.g.
<pre>ADODB_Session::filter(new ADODB_Compress_Bzip2());<br>ADODB_Session::filter(new ADODB_Encrypt_MD5());<br></pre>
will compress and then encrypt the record in the database.
<h2>Session Cookie Regeneration: adodb_session_regenerate_id()</h2>
<p>Dynamically change the current session id with a newly generated one and update
  database. Currently only works with cookies. Useful to improve security by
  reducing the risk of session-hijacking. See this article on <a href=http://shiflett.org/articles/security-corner-feb2004>Session
  Fixation</a> for more info 
on the theory behind this feature. Usage:<pre>
	include('path/to/adodb/session/adodb-session2.php');
	
	session_start();
	# Approximately every 10 page loads, reset cookie for safety.
	# This is extremely simplistic example, better 
	# to regenerate only when the user logs in or changes
	# user privilege levels.
	if ((rand()%10) == 0) adodb_session_regenerate_id(); 
</pre>
<p>This function calls session_regenerate_id() internally or simulates it if the function does not exist.
<h2>Vacuum/Optimize Database</h2>
<p>During session garbage collection, if postgresql is detected,
  ADOdb can be set to run VACUUM. If mysql is detected, then optimize database
  could be called.You can turn this on or off using:</p>
